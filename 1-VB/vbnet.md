# Encapsulation in .Net

- Solutions make up an application
  - group of projects that work together
  - can be heterogeneuos
    - you can have a project written in vb, another written in c#
  - usually characterized as your .sln files
    - this .sln file enumerates the projects that are part of the solution
- Projects group together namespaces, classes and other types
- Classes group together data and logic that go together
- Do note that encapsulation is about wrapping data and logic that go together in one unit
  - This is accomplished by: data wrapping (encaps via packaging) and data hiding (access mods)

## Programming with VB

- No semi colons
- case insensitive

### Methods in VB

- 2 types of methods: subs and functions
- Subs return void
- Functions return something
- Both of these execute some logic when you call on them
