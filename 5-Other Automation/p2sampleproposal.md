## Overview

If you have ever had money in the stock market, you might find yourself constantly checking on your money. It's not a bad thing, but it can be time consuming. We as humans like to focus our attention on money especially if there is a chance we might lose or gain some of it. The stock market is a beautiful thing, but we sometimes also need to focus our attention on other more important things during the day. This is where our friend automation comes into play. If there was a way to monitor your stocks without being glued to your screen all day, why wouldn't you do that?

## What is our Automation Project About

Our automation project is centered around monitoring the market for a given user's stock(s). Wouldn't it be nice to check the performance of your stock(s) at only one point in the day? This can easily be achieved with our Stock Manager automation robot. Moreover, you can spend little to no time obtaining a graphical representation of your stock(s') performance by receiving a daily email from our bot.

_Our Goals for the Robot_

- The goal of our robot is to fully leverage UIPATH Studio to interact with the web and monitor a given stock every 30 minutes.
- We plan to provide the user with the overall day performance of their stock(s) when the market closes via email.
  - The market closes everyday at 5pm EST.
- The information about each stock will be obtained through Google and represented graphically through Excel.

_What are Our Qualifications to Build this Robot?_

- I'm glad you asked! For the past few weeks, our group has been studying night and day the ins and outs of UIPATH Studio. Whether it be learning how to speak to the web or manipulating data, we are becoming increasingly confident using the studio.
- In addition, the three of us plan to continue expanding our knowledge in this domain for the next few weeks, so that we can continue to build our robot and provide the end user with the most efficient representation of their stock performance yet!

## Why is it Important?

We believe that our robot is something that the general public is ready for. Most people are used to having technologies take over and monitor the tedious and various tasks in our lives. For example, sharing code via github within a group of software developers or even something as meager as loading your washing machine and running a quick cycle are both made easier through automation. Our robot will be a combination of technologies we are already accustomed to using in our day-to-day lives. Why should something as important as investments be any different?
